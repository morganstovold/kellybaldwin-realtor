                  A LIFELONG COMMITMENT
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  My real estate journey started in mortgage in 2001, providing
                  me with a solid foundation in finance before transitioning
                  into commercial real estate with a focus on 1031 Exchanges.
                  However, it was in residential real estate where I found my
                  true callingâ€”helping families turn houses into homes and
                  dreams into reality.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  For over 30 years, Benicia has been home to me, my husband
                  James, and our children James and Emily. Our home is filled
                  with laughter, love, and a deep sense of community that drives
                  everything I do.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Beyond real estate, I&apos;ve dedicated countless hours
                  volunteering with local organizations throughout Solano
                  County. This community involvement has given me an intimate
                  understanding of what makes each neighborhood special and
                  reinforced my passion for helping others find their perfect
                  place to call home.
