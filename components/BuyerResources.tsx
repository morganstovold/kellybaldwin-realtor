                  Down payment requirements vary by loan type. Conventional loans can be as low as 3%,

                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Closing costs typically range from 2-5% of the purchase price and include fees for 
                  inspections, appraisals, title insurance, and loan processing.

                  From accepted offer to closing typically takes 30-45 days. Finding the right home 
                  can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months depending on your criteria.

                  Should I get pre-approved?

                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Absolutely! Pre-approval shows sellers you're serious and can close the deal. 
                  It also helps you understand your budget and shop with confidence.
